# Spam-detection-using-LSTM-based-Algorithms

This study addresses the smishing problem, a significant cybersecurity issue where attackers target smartphone users via text messages. Smishing, a subset of spam messages, contains malicious 
links or attachments intended to steal user details. This manuscript presents a neural networkbased algorithm, specifically utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to efficiently detect smishing attemptsâ€™ networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), are leveraged to analyse SMS messages by detecting patterns and anomalies indicative of phishing. The study involves preprocessing SMS data through tokenization and normalization, followed by training LSTM models on labelled datasets of both legitimate and malicious messages. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, showcasing its effectiveness in distinguishing smishing messages from benign ones. Results indicate that LSTM networks can effectively learn and identify subtle cues in textual data, offering a promising solution for enhancing mobile security against smishing attacks. The neural network outperformed other machine learning algorithms by 1.11%.The proliferation of mobile communication has heightened the need for robust security measures against emerging threats such as smishing (SMS phishing). Ultimately, the motivation is to safeguard individuals and organizations from the detrimental effects of smishing, thereby fostering a safer digital environment for all
